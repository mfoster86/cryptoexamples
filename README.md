# cryptoexamples
Some basic examples of public key cryptography and the math behind the scenes using python.


## Dependencies
You will need pycryptodome: https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/introduction.html

pip install pycryptodome

## How To
The scratchgenrsa.py is where most of the fun is at. No input is required, simply execute the script and you will get two files, a public and private key pair.
There are some other scripts in here that allow you to check for primes, semiprimes, and do some encrypt/decrypt using a well known library, pycryptodome.
